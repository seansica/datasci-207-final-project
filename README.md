# W207 Final Project - Detecting Cyber Threat Events with Bi-directional LSTM CNN Model

## Description

This project is for the DATASCI 207 final project at UC Berkeley. It includes a PyPi (Python) artifact called 'dosdetect' that implements machine learning pipelines to train multi-classification models on malicious packet detection. The models are trained to detect 13 different categories/classes of malicious packets, in addition to the negative/benign class.

The 'dosdetect' source code and installation instructions are included in the `dosdetect` folder.

## Project Organization

The project is organized into several directories:

- `dosdetect`: This directory contains the source code for the `dosdetect` tool.

- `eda`: This directory contains Jupyter notebook files used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and general development.

- `papers`: This directory includes the CIC-IDS2017 paper that inspired the selection of the training dataset.

- `pipeline_runs`: This directory includes example output pipeline runs for each of the supported models. These are archived and committed with Git Large File Storage (LFS).

- `submissions`: This directory contains deliverables such as assignment papers and PowerPoint presentations.

- `visualizations`: This directory contains images and OmniGraffle source files used for visualizations.
